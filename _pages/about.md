I am associate professor at the IT University of Copenhagen (<a href="https://www.itu.dk">ITU</a>) and a member of the Center for Information Security and Trust (<a href="https://cisat.dk">CISAT</a>). I have previously worked as a post-doc in the Security, Usability and Society (<a href="https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/index.php">SECUSO</a>) research group at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.kit.edu">KIT</a>), in particular, collaborating on the EU Project "Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control" (<a href="https://www.ghost-iot.eu">GHOST</a>), and before that, at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt (<a href="https://www.tu-darmstadt.de">TUDa</a>). I have received my doctorate from TUDa in 2017.

My research interests focus on human and societal factors in cybersecurity and privacy. This includes such topics as:

- Cyberwarfare and effects of geopolitical tensions on cybersecurity for organisations and individuals
- Organisational aspects of cybersecurity in tech companies and critical infrastructure
- Effects of AI technologies on cybersecurity and privacy behavior
- E-voting and other forms of e-participation, incl. aspects of cryptography and human factors as well as issues of coercion resistance and verifiability
- Privacy, incl. human factors and technical solutions for privacy-enchancing technologies, privacy decision support, privacy notices, usable privacy settings, transparency
- Cybersecurity and privacy technologies for high-risk and marginalised populations
- Trust and acceptance of cybersecurity- and privacy-critical technologies

**Potential student projects:** Contact me if you are interested in doing a project, including writing a Bachelor/Master thesis, related to these interests.

Projects (selected)
------
Ongoing:
- **UCORV** (Usable and Coercion-Resistant Voting) funded by [Independent Research Fund Denmark](https://dff.dk) (Inge Lehmann Program). Project goal: design and evaluate methods that allow voters to cast their votes in Internet voting systems while avoiding coercion.
- **ODC** (Optimising Denmark's Cyber Emergency) funded by [National Defence Technology Center](https://nfc.dk). Project goal: investigate the impact of cyberwarfare activities on critical infrastructure in Denmark and Ukraine and derive recommendations for better protection and preparedness against large-scale cyberattacks.

Past:
- **ASCD** (Assessment of the Status of Cybersecurity in Denmark) funded by the [Danish Centre for Cybersecurity](https://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/Pages/cfcs.aspx). Project goal: investigating cybersecurity and privacy practices in Danish companies.
- **COMET** (Communicating Trust in the Security of Election Technologies) funded by [Velux Foundation](https://veluxfoundations.dk/en) (Villum Experiment Program). Project goal: understand how trust in election technologies is created and maintained among the voters, and how should voting systems be designed in order to facilitate this trust.
